# Detailed Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio developed for the ETCCCP105 course assignment. It is built as a static webpage using HTML and CSS to demonstrate core web development skills and professional version control practices. The site showcases my academic and technical skills, specifically my specialization in AI and Machine Learning.

## Development Process

1. **Setup:** The repository was cloned from GitHub, and the initial files (index.html, style.css, etc.) were added. The .gitignore and docs/ structure were set up first.
2. **Structure (Commit 1):** The HTML file was structured first, creating the header, navigation, and core sections (ABOUT, PROJECTS, CONTACT) using semantic HTML5 tags.
3. **Styling (Commit 2):** CSS was applied, focusing on a dark background/light content theme. A critical part was ensuring **responsiveness** using `@media screen and (max-width: 600px)` to look good on mobile devices.
4. **Readme (Commit 3):** The project features and usage were summarized in the main README.md.

5. **Documentation (Commit 4):** The documentation folder is added for explaining this project.
